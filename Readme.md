Spider-Man Fan Site Project

    Project description:

The project was carried out with evaluative purposes.

It consists of a website about the fictional character Spider-Man, covering his characteristics and adaptations.

It is divided into 5 parts:

Home: A brief presentation with a background of all versions of the character.

About: Part where he is presented in more detail and his most striking stories.

Powers: A part where I present your powers and detail them together with images/gifs.

Films: I present his film adaptations and detail each of the character's films ever made.

    Creation steps:

I organized the structures in the HTML and added the tags to edit the GRID in the CSS.

After that, I linked the pages in HEAD and edited them to be more uniform.

After that, I added the images and texts that I would use in the project.

I searched Google Fonts for a font that I liked and imposed it on Nunito.

I researched SVG icons and added some for social media links.

    Technologies used:

Google Fonts; Flowbite; Tenor.
